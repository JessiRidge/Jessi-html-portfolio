<h2>My top 3 (meaningful) movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<p> <i> Part of the reason these movies are so meaningful to me is because of the changes that were taking place in my
        life when I first saw them in the theaters.</p></i>
<H3> The Matrix </H3>
<p> I saw this movie in 1999. <br>
    The plot had an impact on me so much that I decided to become vegetarian.</p>

<h3> The Matrix: Reloaded </h3>
<p> I saw this movie in May of 2003.<br>
    The next month I finalized my divorce.
</p>

<h3> The Matix: Revolutions </h3>
<p> I saw this movie in November of 2003.<br>
    At this time I was in a new wonderful and loving relationship. </p>
