<h1>Welcome to my basic webpage!</h1>

<h2>Jessi Ridgeway</h2>

<h3> <u> Background</u></h3>
<p>I was born in Cleveland, Ohio. When I was in 5th grade I attended a Cleveland Orchestra youth concert during a school
  field trip. I was amazed by the sound and remember recognizing the fourth movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. The
  timpani player (Cloyd Duff) was fantastic to watch. I was completely mesmorized. When I was 11 years old, I started
  drum lessons and studied with some amazing teachers.</p>

<h3><u>Education</u></h3>
<p>I recieved my Bachelor Degree in Music in Percussion Performace from Stetson University in DeLand, FL and my Master
  Degre in Music in Percussion Performace from New England Conservatory in Boston, MA. I've been playing professionally
  in orchestras ever since!</p>

<h3><u>Performing</u></h3>
<p>Ever since I was 15years old, I have been playing drums for money. Each week I am given new music to learn for
  upcoming concert series. I spend a lot of time listening to and thinking about how I want to perform each piece. I
  make a plan to practice each day. Then every week I go onstage and perform some of the greatest pieces of music ever
  written by composers. It's a lot of fun to work with other artists and learn from their interpreations as well.
In addition to performing live concerts, I have performed, engineered, and produced numerous recordings for various artists.</p>

<h3><u>Other Professional Skills</u></h3>

<h4>Accounting & Bookkeeping</h4>

<p>Besides performing professionally in orchetras, I also have other interests and skils. I teach private drum lessons
  to middle school, high school and college students. During COVID, when orchestras and concert halls were shut-down, I
  enrolled and
  was accepted into a university program to study accounting and computer science. I worked as bookkeeper for serveral
  years assisting two different accountants and working with hundreds of clients. Now, I now work remotely as a
  bookkeeper in my home office; this works well with my performing schedule.</p>

<h4>Computer Programming & Web Development</h4>

<p>During my studies at USF, I discovered that I really enjoyed creating web pages and learning new languages. Although
  most of my time then was spent creating Front-End website projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am now very
  interested in learning the Back-End side of development. I'm using the same work ethic to learn programming as I did
  with learning music. I create a plan for practicing and learning new languages and frameworks, create projects to
  practice, and hope to improve my knowledge and skills in order to make a career change and work professionally as a
  programmer.

<h3><u>Other Interests</u></h3>
<p>Hiking is one of my favorite things to do! Whenever I have the opportunity, I love to travel to beautiful, scenic
  areas and
  spend a few days hiking. I also love doing my ashtanga yoga practice most mornings (after coffee!). I have two super
  affectionate and helpful
  orange tabby cats that make sure I wakeup early each day. I enjoy playing chess and meeting up with friends for tea.
